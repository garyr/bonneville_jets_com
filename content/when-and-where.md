Bonneville Jets is an annual radio control turbine jet event bringing together some of the most talented pilots and sophisticated aircraft in the Western United States. We fly on the **Bonneville Salt Flats** at **Misty Way RC Field** in Grantsville, Utah, once a year, every summer. **2021 was our first event;** we've been running ever since.

This is an **AMA-sanctioned event**. Pilots need current AMA membership and a **turbine waiver** to participate. The event is focused on turbine jets; it is not intended for EDF aircraft or other non-turbine warbirds. Spectators and families are welcome. Only pilots and spotters are allowed at the flight line for safety; everyone else stays behind the line. See the [FAQ](faq.html) for more on fees, facilities, and requirements.
